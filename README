Simple perl script to generate a ripple test (as used
for testing line printers).

A program to do this used to be part of the standard (BSD?) distribution.
I keep finding the need for something like this (when prodding at lumpy ssh 
connections and similar) and rewriting it.

Current version doesn't take any options to control number of 
lines or width.
